## About

Our mission at ZEIT is to make the cloud accessible to everyone. We do that by creating products that improve developer experience, provisioning infrastructure that is globally available, and by teaching the developer community about serverless-related technology. We made VRS to showcase that it’s possible to create a fully functional, high-performance e-commerce store without requiring infrastructure know-how.
